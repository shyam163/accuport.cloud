Accuport is a platform that provides marine onboard chemical test solutions
we need to fetch all the available data from labcom database and then format it a bit to store into a sqlite database (accubase.sqlite)
we need to create a python program to that effect.
for every vessel there will be a diffent auth token and labcom account




Enhanced Tables:

  1. SAMPLING_POINTS - Added activity tracking and location info
  2. PARAMETERS - Added ideal ranges, category, and criticality levels
  3. MEASUREMENTS - Major enhancements:
    - String + numeric value storage
    - Quality control fields (ideal_status, ideal_low/high)
    - Operator and device tracking
    - Data validation flags
    - Multiple indexes for performance

  New Tables:

  4. ALERTS - Automatic out-of-range detection
    - 7 alerts automatically generated from MV October data
    - Tracks TOO LOW, TOO HIGH, CRITICAL conditions
    - Acknowledgment and resolution workflow
  5. PARAMETER_LIMITS - Custom limits per sampling point
    - Three-tier thresholds (ideal/warning/critical)
    - Time-based limits support
  6. FETCH_LOGS - Enhanced with detailed statistics

  📊 Test Results (MV October)

  ✓ 67 measurements stored with full quality control data
  ✓ 7 automatic alerts generated for out-of-range values
  ✓ 19 sampling points synced
  ✓ 25 unique parameters tracked
  ✓ All data includes operator, device, and timestamp info

  🚨 Sample Alerts Detected

  - Iron-in-Oil: 3 scavenge drains below minimum (20-35 mg/l vs 50-450 expected)
  - Composite Boiler: 4 parameters out of range (chloride, alkalinity, phosphate)

  📁 Files Created/Modified

  Modified:
  - db_schema.py - Enhanced schema
  - data_manager.py - Updated for new fields

  Created:
  - fetch_and_store.py - Enhanced fetch script
  - SCHEMA_ENHANCEMENTS.md - Complete documentation

  🚀 How to Use

  # Fetch and store data for any vessel
  cd src
  python fetch_and_store.py mv_october 30

  # Or for other vessels
  python fetch_and_store.py mv_racer 60
  python fetch_and_store.py mt_aqua 30

  💡 Key Benefits

  1. Automatic Quality Monitoring - Alerts generated instantly for out-of-range values
  2. Full Traceability - Know who tested what, when, and with which device
  3. Flexible Data Storage - Handles both string and numeric values
  4. Performance Optimized - Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
  5. Future-Ready - Supports custom limits and time-based ranges

  The enhanced schema is now production-ready and tested with real Labcom data! All 4 vessels (MV October, M.V Racer,
   MT Aqua, MT Voyager) can now be fetched and stored with comprehensive quality control tracking.
