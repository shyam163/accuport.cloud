Access to Accuport cloud portal is mainly intended for vessel managers and fleet managers. Normally a vessel manager has 3-5 ships under his managemen and a fleet managert has 3-5 vessel managers under him.

A log in id and password will be provided to the managers.

The manager can log in access data of the vessels under his management only (vessel managers can only see the 2-3 vesels under him , but fleet managers can see all the vessels that under the vessel managers that are under him).

eg vessel_manager_1 hass 2 ships and  vessel_manager_2 has 3 ships and vessel_manager_3 has 4 ships ; and fleet_manager_1 has     vessel_manager_1 and  vessel_manager_2 under him then
   vessel_manager_1 should onlly see his 2 ships
   vessel_manager_2 should onlly see his 2 ships
   fleet_manager_1  should onlly see 5 ships that under his subordinates
